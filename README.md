## About Me 
Hi There! I'm Sandrico and I am a Web Developer from Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. I grew up on the east coast, and started my career with a Geography and Sociology degree, but quickly found myself getting hooked on coding. I started by self-learning through various blog posts, books and articles, but now I'm in the final year of my local colleges Web Programming course ðŸŽ“. 

## My Current Focus
- JavaScript
- React
- Node

## My Passions
I love teaching. It can be as simple as helping classmates or as involved as writing blog posts, but either way I love to help people learn to code. Additionally, I love opportunities to build things that can help people in their everyday lives.
